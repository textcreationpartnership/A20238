         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE INDIFFERENT and Iudicious Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lexander the Great, King of Macedon, amongÅ¿t all other bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons of his honour, hath this not the leaÅ¿t: That in hearing of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, both his eares were open to both parties, Plaintiffe, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant: That being rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, his deciÅ¿ion of the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie might be vpright, not partiall. As this is the duty of euery learned and iudiciall Reader: Å¿o in this queÅ¿tion of mine, I cannot entertaine other thought, then expectance of all inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity: Not onely to haue eares, and all other Å¿enÅ¿es auerÅ¿ed from the tongues and quills of idly-learned Å¿landerers, but alÅ¿o reÅ¿erued vnto a generous equanimitie towards the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arie and equable reply of the Defendant. Not doubting therefore (gentle Reader) of this your diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, I haue written, and dedicated to your hands and hearts, to take, reade, digeÅ¿t and cheriÅ¿h this Apologie of my Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adminiÅ¿tration of my EÅ¿Å¿ence and Liquor of Gold, commonly called Aurum Potabile or Potable Golde: with aÅ¿Å¿urance of cenÅ¿ure on my Å¿ide, though diÅ¿taÅ¿ting the
<pb facs="tcp:280:3"/> A-B-C-darie and Comicall Rayler. If therefore my malicio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners haue heretofore Å¿educed you into Å¿iniÅ¿ter conÅ¿tructions of this cauÅ¿e, it was not your fault, but their poÅ¿ting malice, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating and foreÅ¿talling that better and true Information, which this Apologie freely now offereth, and earneÅ¿tly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth to be Å¿o accepted. Many good men haue iuÅ¿tly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained againÅ¿t the PaÅ¿quelling libertie of traducing Å¿lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers. If a Å¿ufficient concluÅ¿ion Å¿hould reÅ¿t therein, yea, or a moouing Inducement: then you with me muÅ¿t needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e, that no vertue Å¿hall haue his due regard, no man of whatÅ¿oeuer deÅ¿ert, Å¿hall be Å¿ecure of his good name. My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and Å¿atisfaction preÅ¿eruatiue: my Å¿hield and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againÅ¿t the tainted darts of Å¿uch aduerÅ¿aries, Å¿hall bee Å¿ecuritie againÅ¿t foule challenge, ImpoÅ¿Å¿ibilitie of attaint, the warrant of truth: which in her naked Å¿implicitie Å¿hall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine me, in the vprightneÅ¿Å¿e of a good conÅ¿cience againÅ¿t all their attempts, and by Gods grace, powerfully deliuer me. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you therefore (indifferent and Å¿incere Readers) I conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the protection both of this TreatiÅ¿e, and of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine it Å¿elfe therein handled. BecauÅ¿e, as no man is created Å¿olely for his owne particular, but for the profit and good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; (for nature hath made, and charitie commanded a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinitie and neighbourhood betwixt all men) Å¿o this being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially a kinde of vniuerÅ¿all Medicine: it ought not to be reÅ¿trained from the publike te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>der of profit to all men. Socrates being demanded what Countriman he was, anÅ¿wered, not only an Athenian but a CoÅ¿mopolitane, a Cittizen of that great Commonwealth, the whole world. So ought euery good PhyÅ¿ition in the publike profeÅ¿Å¿ion of his facultie, not to burie his talent in the Å¿oyle of one Countrey, but to remember, that the very Character of his calling doth challenge the fruits of his function for all the world, Å¿o far as poÅ¿Å¿ible capacitie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth; Å¿pecially of this neereÅ¿t communitie in ChriÅ¿ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb facs="tcp:280:3"/> Let it not therefore Å¿eeme Å¿trange vnto you, (worthy Readers) that without exception of Countrey or nation, I doe indefinitely appeale vnto all, and in Å¿uch generality conÅ¿igne theÅ¿e fruitions, which long Å¿tudy, labor &amp; chargeable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue confirmed vnto me, in my profeÅ¿Å¿ion and PractiÅ¿e of PhyÅ¿icke.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation of the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿our.

AlÅ¿o that Å¿o generall a Medicine may as generally be knowne to be had, to the intent to be vÅ¿ed in all places. The opinion of euery excellent, both ancient, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne PhyÅ¿itions, concerning the virtue, power, efficacie and vÅ¿e of Potable gold, is conueÅ¿ted in their owne writings: who do hold firme, that no PhyÅ¿ition can well Å¿aue the performing honour of his profeÅ¿Å¿ion, without Potable gold, howÅ¿oeuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e he be furniÅ¿hed with herball Medicines. In which kind alÅ¿o, God hath Å¿tored Å¿o many particular adiuments, for the reliefe of mans miÅ¿erable maladies, that none ought to neglect the indagation of their virtues, the preparation of their parts, and adminiÅ¿tration of their Remedies.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout fiue yeares paÅ¿t I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hed a Å¿hort diÅ¿courÅ¿e for the AÅ¿Å¿ertion of Chymicall Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ick, and of true Potable gold, containing theÅ¿e heades or Chapters. 1. Whether gold may be Å¿o diÅ¿Å¿olued, that it become truly potable. 2. That the higheÅ¿t and moÅ¿t powerfull excellencie of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines is in Mettals. 3. That amongÅ¿t all Mettals gold hath the prerogatiue, concerning the PhyÅ¿icall vÅ¿e of Medicine. 4. Of what manner is the Art, and myÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to diÅ¿Å¿olue gold, and diÅ¿till it vp: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is called, Drawing ouer the helme. 5. That it were requiÅ¿ite by publike queÅ¿tion to examine and try this truth of this MagiÅ¿terie, that Å¿o the mouth of all gainÅ¿ayers might be Å¿topped. 6. That Potable gold deÅ¿erueth the name of a Generall or vniuerÅ¿all Medicine: and of the manifold vÅ¿e, and efficacie of mine owne Potable gold.</p>
            <p>This TreatiÅ¿e of mine, containing a Å¿imple, naked and plaine deliuerie of a Å¿imple and naked truth, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:280:5"/> therefore as Å¿imply and plainly in words and Å¿tyle Å¿et forth, though it really Å¿atisfied both here and in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine parts many learned men, Iudiciall louers of truth, yet it wanted not the common lot of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to finde maleuolent eyes and detracting encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berers: Å¿uch as may Å¿eeme either with blinde zeale, or ignorant opinion of omniÅ¿cience, rather to repine at a fee loÅ¿t, then deÅ¿ire the true knowledge of that, which they neuer intending to labour for, yet ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly deÅ¿ire an imputation of criticall knowledge therein. The Å¿and of this deÅ¿cent was chiefely, if not only in London. The IÅ¿Å¿ue, none haue greater cauÅ¿e to mourne for, then the Printers for want of vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or rather they which bare the charge of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: for vnto Iudiciall Readers, thoÅ¿e labours of theirs, though they were tedious and nauÅ¿eous, yet Å¿ome recreation followed in laughing at Å¿o much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tetrication of Å¿uch mountaines in the parturition of Å¿uch ridiculous mice. I hope none will expect a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit anÅ¿wer of me to their moÅ¿t powerfull arguments, being, in the moÅ¿t modeÅ¿t terme, a Å¿hamble of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and effrenat Å¿colding: but rather truth and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againÅ¿t falÅ¿hood &amp; words, leauing their tongs and gooÅ¿e-quils, to the iudgement and cenÅ¿ure of their owne reformed and better aduiÅ¿ed hearts: of which my charitie perÅ¿wades me not wholly to deÅ¿paire: knowing Å¿ome learned gentlemen of the Å¿ame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, not the Å¿ame minde, ready to bluÅ¿h at Å¿uch a publication, which all the learned men of ChriÅ¿ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do laugh: And who can fancy Å¿uch barking Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke, wherein not only good words, are made the meaÅ¿ures of madnes, but precious houres are conÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in frothy rablings? If they be Å¿till of the Å¿ame Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, I wiÅ¿h them thereof full contentment therein:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:280:5"/> And that therefore they would in Å¿ome hollow crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy place Å¿tretch out their own Å¿traines, that 1000. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of intereÅ¿t might bountifully returne them their delightfull termes and SyllogiÅ¿mes in this their new Barbara. But this my Apologie Å¿hall with much tranquillity, I hope, anÅ¿wer them, defend mine owne reputation and integritie, vindicate this verity que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tioned; giue eÅ¿timation to potable gold, and make the vÅ¿e thereof more common. According to which intentions I haue diuided this TreatiÅ¿e in three parts. In the firÅ¿t Å¿hall be proued and maintained that which in my firÅ¿t printed booke was deliuered concerning gold, that it may be made potable and medicinable, and be eÅ¿teemed for a kinde of generall Medicine, or neere thereto. In the Å¿econd I will Å¿atiÅ¿fie and Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prooue by irrefragable teÅ¿timonies, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that this my Medicine Å¿o much canuaÅ¿ed, both is made and doth conÅ¿iÅ¿t of gold, and alÅ¿o performeth the true effects, mentioned to be incident vnto pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gold. In the third part I will Å¿hew and teach the way how to vÅ¿e this Medicine in euery particular diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿e. That all pacified and indifferent perÅ¿ons, fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of truth, and embracers of Gods bleÅ¿Å¿ings, may enioy the fruition thereof. Some circumÅ¿tances alÅ¿o I haue hereunto annexed, Å¿uch as are pertinent to this our intent.</p>
            <p>It is a controuerÅ¿ed queÅ¿tion: Whether there bee or may bee made a generall or vniuerÅ¿all Medicine, good for all DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es. Many hold the negatiue. If they Å¿peake preciÅ¿ely of all DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es without diÅ¿tincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I Å¿ay as they doe, and conÅ¿ent. For there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fatall, mortall and Incurable DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es, againÅ¿t which all conÅ¿ultation and counÅ¿ell of PhyÅ¿icke is bootleÅ¿Å¿e. Therefore that my aÅ¿Å¿ertion of a generall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:280:6"/> Medicine be rightly vnderÅ¿tood, I deÅ¿ire my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to bee truly and diÅ¿tinctly taken. For I know that Å¿ome diÅ¿eaÅ¿es be natiue and hereditarie: Å¿ome cauÅ¿ed by Å¿ome outward and Å¿uperuenient chance or accident: Å¿ome proceeding of Å¿imple diÅ¿temper: Å¿ome of humors ioyned therewith. ThoÅ¿e which are natiue and hereditarie, are generally thought, and for the moÅ¿t part be all incurable, though they may in Å¿ome kinde receiue alleuiation and eaÅ¿e: And Å¿ome of them alÅ¿o in the title of thoÅ¿e which happen by Å¿uperueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent accident: As luxations, lameneÅ¿Å¿e, Impotencies, want or Å¿uperfluitie of Å¿ome ioynt, blindneÅ¿Å¿e, deafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, Ambiguitie of Å¿exe, &amp;c. And theÅ¿e Å¿o farre as they be reÅ¿taurable and capable of Cure, are chiefely vnder that part of this facultie which is called Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie, and requireth the hand, though not alwaies and in all caÅ¿es. But thoÅ¿e Infirmities and DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es of the other kinde, proceeding of inward cauÅ¿es within the body, Å¿uch as, for the moÅ¿t part, be all Maladies whereupon all Rationall PhyÅ¿itions are exerciÅ¿ed, if by adminiÅ¿tration of one Medicine they all (I meane, Å¿o long as they are accounted curable by Rationall PhyÅ¿itions) may be eaÅ¿ed, mitigated and perhaps per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, Å¿urely Å¿uch Medicine, ought and may be accounted reÅ¿pectiuely a generall Medicine. For as that PhyÅ¿ition is to be accounted perfect, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall MaÅ¿ter of his Art which knoweth according to his title, facultie and profeÅ¿Å¿ion, how to cure all diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿es, though he leaue and giue ouer Å¿ome as incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; not for wnat of fit meanes and skill in all caÅ¿es of poÅ¿Å¿ibilitie, but through ineptitude and indiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the Å¿ubiect being vncapable of redintegration: So alÅ¿o that Å¿hall be accounted a Medicine vniuerÅ¿all, which cureth moÅ¿t and the greateÅ¿t diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:280:6"/> not all: not through defect of efficacie in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine it Å¿elfe, but reÅ¿pectiuely for the inhabilitie of the Å¿ubiect.</p>
            <p>This alÅ¿o may be proued by reaÅ¿on deriued from<note place="margin">1 The firÅ¿t rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on.</note> thoÅ¿e Medicines of Rationall PhyÅ¿itians, which for the multiplicitie of their operatiue extent to many intentions, and curing of many diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, are called PolychreÅ¿ta, that is, of many vÅ¿es. For if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them Å¿uch as be helpful not to one only Å¿ingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affection, but to many different diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, why is it not likewiÅ¿e conÅ¿equent and reaÅ¿onable that by help of Art, a Medicine may be made much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenÅ¿iue of efficacie vpon diÅ¿eaÅ¿es? And as it may bee made to exceede in one degree, Å¿o in 2. 3. 4. 100. and from PolychreÅ¿ton, of many vÅ¿es, be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon, vniuerÅ¿all, of all vÅ¿es. The reaÅ¿on is all one to reaÅ¿onable men.</p>
            <p>If obiection be made, that Å¿uch PolychreÅ¿t is arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially made by compoÅ¿ition of many things, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are diuerÅ¿itie of natures. And this vniuerÅ¿all of one onely, which implieth an impoÅ¿Å¿ibilitie of different and contrary operatiue faculties: to this I anÅ¿were, that PolychreÅ¿ts are made out of Simples without commixtion: As from Rheubarbe, Vineger, Lead, Niter, Vitriall, Opium, Camphire, and many other, wherof Å¿ome doe both looÅ¿e and knit, Å¿ome do heate and coole, Å¿ome haue other contrary effects, which appeare in their operations, and are teÅ¿tified by Writers. TheÅ¿e things being thus in impure mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and vnperfect bodies, what doubt can there be made of the high prerogatiue and Å¿upreme excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Gold, which all the learned and experienced antiquity, and the continued deriuation from thence vnto this day haue acknowledged and magnified for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:280:7"/> the chiefe, if not only TreaÅ¿urie, and rich Cabinet of vniuerÅ¿alitie and PanchreÅ¿ticke Medicine: In which all the dowers of all other Medicines, whatÅ¿oeuer are written and experimentally found, be vnited and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally incloÅ¿ed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas the originall of moÅ¿t diÅ¿eaÅ¿es<note place="margin">2 The Å¿econd reaÅ¿on.</note> Å¿pringeth from that, which the PhyÅ¿itions call <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies,</hi> that is, a diÅ¿temperature, being eÅ¿pecially in the firÅ¿t qualities, hot, cold, moiÅ¿t or drie; there is no reaÅ¿on to the contrary, but that one Medicine, being without exceÅ¿Å¿e or defect, in equall harmonie of all qualities moÅ¿t temperate, and alÅ¿o powerfull in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, may bee Å¿ufficient for the collection, qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and rectifying of all and euery Å¿uch diÅ¿temper. Such a like body is gold: which notwithÅ¿tanding it be compounded of the foure Elements, yet is this in prerogatiue aboue all other naturall bodies, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with an exact temperament and equalitie of the compounding Elements, and Elementall qualities. Euery one to the other three, and all foure to and among themÅ¿elues by exact naturall equalitie and perfect mixture, are Å¿o compounded to the perfection of this body, that it conÅ¿tantly perÅ¿iÅ¿teth in the fire without diminution. From this proportionall mixture of Elements reÅ¿ulteth a temperament of Å¿upreme mediocritie: whereupon that our learned and famous countryman <hi>Roger Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> calleth <hi>Gold the meane betweene the foure firÅ¿t qualities.</hi> Seeing therefore by Gods gift in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it conÅ¿iÅ¿teth of Å¿o true an adequation and Å¿ubtile temperament, this muÅ¿t needs appeare and Å¿hew it Å¿elfe operatiuely in conÅ¿equent effects vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t qualities, and be powerfull againÅ¿t all diÅ¿temperatures, whether hot or cold, moyÅ¿t or dry, or any their combinations: FirÅ¿t allaying and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:280:7"/> any exceÅ¿Å¿e therein, and Å¿o by degrees and Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ion ouercomming the whole diÅ¿cord, and reÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mediocritie of temperament betweene all. So that the generall Axiome or Rule of great <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> is here magnified: That DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es are cured by Medicines contrarie to themÅ¿elues. For the meane betwixt two extremes is no leÅ¿Å¿e contrarie to both and either of them, then one extreme to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and more powerfull in reduction, by how much it is more habituall and fixed in the vnÅ¿potted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocritie and equalitie. Let this be vnderÅ¿tood of gold diÅ¿Å¿olued and made potable, otherwiÅ¿e it is not operatiue vpon thoÅ¿e diÅ¿tempered qualities in one kinde or other</p>
            <p>The third ReaÅ¿on concerneth the temper of the bodie to bee cured. Death (Å¿aith <hi>Galen</hi>) doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies<note place="margin">3 The third reaÅ¿on.</note> follow the vnmeaÅ¿urable or exceÅ¿Å¿iue diÅ¿tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures of the Heart. So likewiÅ¿e doe DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es. For all parts of the bodie languiÅ¿h with the Heart. Let vs therefore conÅ¿ider a little the Emperie of the Heart in mans bodie, how by his owne heate and vitall Å¿pirit, it raigneth ouer, and in all parts of the bodie. Let vs alÅ¿o take into conÅ¿ideration the diÅ¿temperature of other parts making impreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion vpon the Heart, and Å¿o are cauÅ¿es of languiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and death. VVhich beeing on either Å¿ide certaine, then it muÅ¿t alÅ¿o bee true, that if golde adminiÅ¿tred doe reÅ¿tore integritie of temperament to the Heart, the other parts and members of the bodie Å¿hall alÅ¿o receiue comfort, Å¿trength, reÅ¿tauration, and finally life to the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. VVherefore the firÅ¿t office of euerie good PhyÅ¿ition is, to haue Å¿peciall regarde, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:280:8"/> and vphold the Å¿pirituall functions of his diÅ¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed patient, which all haue their originall from the heart. For if he Å¿uffer them to quaile, and ouer much to bee deiected, all Cordialls will then come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eaÅ¿onably. That admonition is iuÅ¿t and neceÅ¿Å¿arie <hi>FirÅ¿t Å¿trengthen and comfort the Heart, then apply for the DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e,</hi> if neede be: for oft times, the Heart being well corroborated, the DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e imminent vaniÅ¿heth. But Å¿ome will aske, how gold, Å¿o hard, Å¿olide and compact, and therefore indigeÅ¿table by any Å¿trength of mans Å¿tomacke, can paÅ¿Å¿e from thence to the heart, and Å¿trengthen, comfort, rectifie and reÅ¿tore it; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conÅ¿idering that theÅ¿e and Å¿uch like faculties come to it by the plentie of pure, cleere, and Å¿ubtill Å¿pirits of the blood, which cannot be made of any thing not digeÅ¿ted both in the Stomack and Lyuer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of gold. In anÅ¿wer whereof I Å¿ay, that long and daily obÅ¿eruation hath confirmed, that many things naturally are effected by the hidden and Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall properties of Å¿ome things, whereof no vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding of man can giue a certaine and vndiÅ¿puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manifeÅ¿t cauÅ¿e or reaÅ¿on. We Å¿ee the affinitie of natures betweene Iron and the Lode-Å¿tone, and the pointing of this to the North Pole. Of which kinde there be infinite exemplarie inÅ¿tances. Neither doe the moÅ¿t learned PhyÅ¿itions and beÅ¿t PhiloÅ¿ophers Å¿o well agree vpon the reaÅ¿ons of thoÅ¿e Purging Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which they call Electiue, as appropriate Å¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to one humour: and diuers others to Å¿ome Å¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all part of the bodie, yea and to Å¿ome Å¿peciall diÅ¿eaÅ¿es: but that a great part of them doe flie to theÅ¿e hidden and Å¿pecificall properties, Å¿ome in the Å¿ame, Å¿ome in other termes. In which ranke if wee marÅ¿hall gold, what Lieuetenant will chide? He certainly muÅ¿t be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:280:8"/> Å¿ome ouerweening man, that will queÅ¿tion theÅ¿e no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertues of gold, that hath read Å¿o many notable and famous Authors for that affirmatiue aÅ¿Å¿ertion, part whereof I haue cited in my other booke, being but one Rank of a whole Armie. Here I will only trouble the Reader with a few lines out of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous PhyÅ¿ition and excellent PhiloÅ¿opher <hi>Arnald. Gold altereth the euill condition of mans body, clenÅ¿eth and reneweth it. The vertue of many things may come neere the particulars of the operation hereof, but no one performe it all. But potable gold alone is it which worketh theÅ¿e mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous effects: this is not Å¿ubiect to corruption, but is agreeable to the Complexion and temperament of man. It doth neither heate, nor coole, nor moyÅ¿ten, nor dry: but is temperate in all temperature, and exceedeth all things in durabilitie: It hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a cold Å¿tomacke, and giueth courage to Cowards and fearefull hearts: It helpeth the paÅ¿Å¿ions of the Heart: It is good againÅ¿t Melancholy: It comforteth naturall heate and tempereth the Å¿ame, neither may any thing be compared to it or Å¿upply the Å¿tead thereof. The vertue thereof is manifeÅ¿t in the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of it. It clenÅ¿eth and clarifieth by reaÅ¿on of the naturall heate it hath. It giueth high and Å¿upreame tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aboue all other things, by reaÅ¿on of the great tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it Å¿elfe: and beeing it Å¿elfe moÅ¿t durable, it cauÅ¿eth continuance and durabilitie, according to naturall poÅ¿Å¿ibility in other things, and preÅ¿erueth mans body. And becauÅ¿e it is like to the Complexion of mens bodie, therefore if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as it ought, it will ioyne and incorporate thereunto. But all the Å¿ecret is in the preparation of it, which the wiÅ¿e Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophers haue concealed. It confirmeth and keepeth Å¿ound the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the Heart, and preÅ¿erueth it, and clarifieth the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the Å¿pirits, and Å¿endeth good blood to the skin, and with a light and eaÅ¿ie abÅ¿terÅ¿ion preÅ¿erueth beauty as in youth.</hi> Thus he writeth, as alÅ¿o in other places of this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:280:9"/> Author you may reade many admirable effects and vertues of gold both Å¿olide and potable. How gold is Å¿o powerfull a Cordiall and Å¿o generall a Medicine, is held a very difficult queÅ¿tion to finde the cauÅ¿e and reaÅ¿on thereof. Let euery mans opinion bee free to himÅ¿elfe. I will without preiudice to any other briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿hew you my opinion. I take it for granted that gold of all mixed bodies is moÅ¿t equall and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the Elements and elementall qualities, Å¿o that moyÅ¿ture with heat as agent, drineÅ¿Å¿e with coldnes as patient and Å¿ubiect to action, are inÅ¿eparably with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall concordance perfectly ioyned. Wherefore gold is reÅ¿pectiuely a body not only incorruptible in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fire, ayre, and earth, and as it were an earthly i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of eternitie, but alÅ¿o moÅ¿t conuenient, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and as it were allied to and with the heart of man, which of his hot moyÅ¿ture doth worke the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Å¿pirits, and maintaine the arteriall beatings of the pulÅ¿e in all parts of the bodie. And this tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of gold muÅ¿t bee conÅ¿idered two waies. FirÅ¿t (as Scholers call it) Arithmetically: hence commeth the equalitie and equabilitie of qualities elementarie in the compact and Å¿olide body thereof, not reÅ¿olued into the permanent forme of potable liquor. In this conÅ¿ideration it were very hard for learned PhyÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that build Å¿o much vpon and preÅ¿Å¿e authoritie, to deny that gold hath and actiuely doth Å¿hew many great effectiue vertues, Å¿eeing the Catalogue is Å¿o great of many notable and famous PhyÅ¿itions which extoll the effects thereof, and at this day doe vÅ¿e it Å¿o much; as of gold quenched in wine, boyled in broth, giuen in limell or foyle in ConÅ¿erues and Electuaries. The hope and end thereof in all their intentions, is to Corroborate and comfort the heart. And this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:280:9"/> temperature in and of gold is habituate and coeÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall with the whole Å¿ubÅ¿tance, matter and forme, in all the Elements both actiue and paÅ¿Å¿iue. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e not the materiall but the formal EÅ¿Å¿ence is moÅ¿t operatiue and profeÅ¿Å¿or of the noble Elements, fire and ayre, from whence reÅ¿ulteth in an indiÅ¿Å¿oluble bond, heate and moyÅ¿ture Å¿o friendly agreeable to mans nature. Therefore gold in his naturall coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Å¿oliditie, cannot Å¿o fully according to the inward power of his naturall efficacie and vertue, Å¿hew and performe the effects thereof, as being reÅ¿ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, opened, and made potable, that the Elements and elementall qualities may more freely both worke and be wrought vpon, and be brought from their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiality to actiuitie in application to the body of man. For then the agent and formall vertues, fire and ayre be predominant in their exaltation. WhoÅ¿e pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, being communicated &amp; applied to &amp; with the Å¿pirits of our body, is to refreÅ¿h, comfort &amp; Å¿trengthen the heart: renew, reÅ¿tore, and increaÅ¿e the Å¿pirits, by that wonderfull facultie, and neere equalitie as it were brotherhood which it hath to them. And this in the Å¿econd conÅ¿ideration of the temperament of Gold Geometricall in that different reÅ¿pect, as the other is called Arithmeticall. In which that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate qualitie friendly and concordant to the heart and temperament of man, and that complexio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned moyÅ¿t heate or hot moyÅ¿ture, is preualent or predominant. And one chiefe reaÅ¿on why <hi>Arnald</hi> before cited and very many others of vnreprooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able authoritie, doe Å¿o much commend, and with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erued Å¿ecrecie admire the excellent dowers of gold, is, that being made potable, it reÅ¿toreth, augmenteth and preÅ¿erueth that our <hi>humidum radicale,</hi> and <hi>calidum
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:280:10"/> innatum,</hi> Naturall heate and moyÅ¿ture, (vnderÅ¿tand them complexioned not diÅ¿tinct) and Å¿o with reÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue poÅ¿Å¿ibilitie, prolongeth life, and keepeth backe old age, I meane the Å¿enÅ¿e of the defects and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof.</p>
            <p>If it be obiected that this exact temperature and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> of mixture in gold being Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, it cannot actiuely operate or worke any thing in mans bodie, becauÅ¿e, as euery action commeth from or by meanes of Å¿ome predominant qualitie, Å¿o equalitie without diÅ¿paragement keepes all in an vndefeazeable bond of an irreÅ¿oluble compound. I anÅ¿wer thus. In caÅ¿es where the intemperature or diÅ¿temper of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e (or the degree thereof in Å¿ome caÅ¿es) is not yet knowne, the doctrine poÅ¿itiue and counÅ¿ell of PhyÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is, to vÅ¿e and adminiÅ¿ter temperate Medicines, which Å¿hall not be offenÅ¿iue manifeÅ¿tly to any quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but indifferent and allowable to all. If this be done with good aduiÅ¿e and reaÅ¿on: in Å¿uch like caÅ¿e, it muÅ¿t needs be far more conÅ¿onant to reaÅ¿on, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoouefull to the patient, to giue Å¿uch a Medicine as is not only temperate by qualification, but Å¿o preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely excellent therein, that it cannot loÅ¿e that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature and the conÅ¿equent efficacie thereof, by the force of any thing conÅ¿onant or diÅ¿Å¿onant. Which is farre otherwiÅ¿e in all vegetables reputed equall in temperament, becauÅ¿e they are apt in Å¿ome caÅ¿es to cauÅ¿e dangerous diÅ¿temperature in mans body. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are plentifull. But for inÅ¿tance take Manna it Å¿elfe reputed a very temperate laxatiue, yet very eaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it Å¿elfe turning into a hot Cholerick humour, and encreaÅ¿ing the Å¿ame, and the diÅ¿temperatures and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿es conÅ¿equent thereupon according to the diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition and inclination of the body receiuing it. Of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:280:10"/> which there is no feare in the vÅ¿e of gold, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons aforeÅ¿aid. Therefore whether the Tenure be: That Contraries be cured by Contraries, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect to the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e and the cauÅ¿e thereof, the qualitie of the Medicine is remedy: Or that like are conÅ¿erued by their like, with regard to the Å¿trength of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and comfort of the heart, according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> Gold (as hath beene prooued) muÅ¿t needs be in both intentions the fitteÅ¿t and moÅ¿t conuenient Medicine and remedy for diÅ¿eaÅ¿es of what temper or diÅ¿temper Å¿oeuer, being aduiÅ¿edly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: Å¿pecially being PhiloÅ¿ophically opened, reÅ¿ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and made potable:</p>
            <p>That there may bee a generall or vniuerÅ¿all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine<note place="margin">4 The fourth reaÅ¿on.</note> is alÅ¿o prooued, by conÅ¿ideration taken from the nature of the perÅ¿on diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, with reference to the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. For if the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e be Å¿trong, like a heauie burden preÅ¿Å¿ing the patient, and the poore patient weake not able to beare out the Critical day of happy iudgement of iÅ¿Å¿ue of the maladie; I aske in this caÅ¿e what ought to be done. Certainly, rather enable the body to the end of the Combate, by comforting and Å¿trengthning the heart, then vainly attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue the log, and Å¿uffer him to Å¿inke vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. For, not the Medicine, but nature alone is the true phyÅ¿ition, curing all infirmities, if Å¿he be not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ed, or that Å¿he be Å¿o releeued, that Å¿trength in her be maintained. It is not vnlike by compariÅ¿on vnto the charge of Å¿umpter Mules or Pack-horÅ¿es, which oft times vÅ¿e to bee fed trauelling that they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to carry their burdens to the Inne, not diÅ¿char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vntimely of their packes. And by this meanes they neede not be vnloaden at euery bayte; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uendred vnder their loads for the quicker diÅ¿patch.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:280:11"/> So no diÅ¿eaÅ¿e is cured, the Å¿trength not maintained: but contrarily by perfect Methode the Å¿trength and power of the body is by degrees to bee reÅ¿tored and comforted, that the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e may be both reÅ¿olued, and life maintained. To this purpoÅ¿e did <hi>Arnaldus</hi> write in theÅ¿e words. <hi>The only intention of ancient PhyÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was, to giue vigor and Å¿trength vnto nature: Who being Å¿trengthned, performeth whatÅ¿oeuer is expedient. And by this meanes they neuer did ouerthrow any man. Therefore neuer ceaÅ¿e to worke with Cordialls in adminiÅ¿tration of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿icke.</hi> This is the counÅ¿ell of <hi>Arnald.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, many diÅ¿eaÅ¿es proceed from obÅ¿tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">The fift rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on.</note> of Å¿ome viÅ¿cous, Å¿lymie and mucilaginous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not Å¿eparated in the veÅ¿Å¿els of concoction, by their imbecillity, either naturall, or accidentall. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if this obÅ¿truent matter be Å¿ubtiliated, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction Å¿hall thereby be taken away, &amp; conÅ¿equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e and accidents of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e cured. Of Å¿uch kinds of ObÅ¿tructions, beÅ¿ides other diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, many kinds of fevers doe ariÅ¿e, burning, rotten, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick, peÅ¿tilent, &amp;c. AlÅ¿o many and dangerous Å¿ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es both hot and cold. AgainÅ¿t which though Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine made of vegetables doe often very much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: yet becauÅ¿e for the moÅ¿t part they be too weak, and leaue no Å¿olide and laÅ¿ting impreÅ¿Å¿ion: or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiÅ¿e worke Å¿o violently, and Å¿eldome without Å¿ome offence, Å¿carce euer with Å¿uch temper, gentlenes and Å¿incerity as is requiÅ¿ite. Therefore that Medicine which being moÅ¿t temperate and equally graduated to the Elementall harmonie of mans body, ought iuÅ¿tly to be preferred both before them and all of that kind. For Å¿uch one cannot by his coldneÅ¿Å¿e offend the complexioned parts, nor by his heate the hot: but by opening and Å¿o promotiuely taking away the ObÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, be equally &amp; certainly profitable to all. <hi>Galen</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:280:11"/> teacheth that the cauÅ¿e is to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> away, by finding out, and applying the true contrary of euery alterable nature. As to cure any diÅ¿eaÅ¿e coming of and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on ObÅ¿truction, is the diÅ¿Å¿oluing of matter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truent, &amp; opening the ObÅ¿truction. This counÅ¿ell we ought to follow in al Å¿uch caÅ¿es, in opening that which is forcibly Å¿hut. And then gentle and quiet reÅ¿titution commeth of temperament to all diÅ¿tempered parts. For, whether the exceÅ¿Å¿e were in heate or cold, the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which were Å¿hut vp in priÅ¿on, now Å¿et at liberty, are refreÅ¿hed, recouer their former vigor, and health to the whole body. If the blood (Å¿aith <hi>Hippocrat.</hi>) be Å¿topped in his courÅ¿e, and the Å¿pirit with it, it cauÅ¿eth chylneÅ¿Å¿e, numneÅ¿Å¿e, giddines, loÅ¿Å¿e or hinderance of Å¿peach, heauines &amp; paine of the head &amp; convulÅ¿ions, after which follow many kinds of the falling Å¿icknes which be accounted cold diÅ¿eaÅ¿es. In briefe, it is moÅ¿t euident, that only ObÅ¿tructions be the cauÅ¿e of many and Å¿undry diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, not only different, but directly contrary each to other. Therfore as one cauÅ¿e brought them in, Å¿o may one Medicine expell them.</p>
            <p>But pauÅ¿e a while. It may be demanded how hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Å¿o exorbita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t &amp; abounding as they do in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of many men, Å¿hal be emptied from thence by the force of any medicine, whoÅ¿e faculty is not to expel or purge by the common paÅ¿Å¿age, and whoÅ¿e intent is to be only Å¿trengthning and comforting the heart.</p>
            <p>To which I anÅ¿wer: It is true, that in many diÅ¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es<note place="margin" type="runSum">Solution.</note> the abundance of humors are Å¿uch cauÅ¿es, that except they be purged away in due and conuenient time and order, it is Å¿carÅ¿e poÅ¿Å¿ible to hope for a Å¿ound recouerie: in vvhich caÅ¿e if Å¿ome gentle Purgation, together vvith the adminiÅ¿tration of this vniuerÅ¿all Medicine be vÅ¿ed, both the Å¿trength Å¿hall be better maintained, Å¿ooner recouered, and the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:280:12"/> Yet though no purgation be giuen, but onely this vniuerÅ¿all Medicine at times adminiÅ¿tred, Å¿uch is the vertue thereof, that Nature it Å¿elfe being Å¿trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and comforted aboue the malice of the offending humors and the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, will expell the burden of thoÅ¿e humors by the moÅ¿t conuenient paÅ¿Å¿ages which that caÅ¿e may require, whether it be by Å¿iege, vomit, vrine, Å¿weate, or other exitures. For the PhyÅ¿ition at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, is not directer and MaÅ¿ter, but miniÅ¿ter and Å¿eruant in fit adminiÅ¿tration vnto nature: which being comforted and Å¿trengthned, will helpe her Å¿elfe beyond all hope and conceit of man, as hath bin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found to the admiration of the greateÅ¿t Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors which hitherto haue written, and happeneth daily in our owne experience. In all diÅ¿eaÅ¿es the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions part is, to promote the indeauour of nature to expel the offending humors by thoÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ages, which herÅ¿elfe Å¿heweth and directeth; with diÅ¿cretion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene criticall and Å¿ymptomaticall euacuations, and of the conueniencie of a few circumÅ¿tances follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the particularities of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e: Of this I could eaÅ¿ily and plentifully bring many irrefragable and demonÅ¿tratiue reaÅ¿ons: but they may partly bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood by that which is already Å¿aid, and partly are written by diuers others graue and learned Authors. Therfore I wil follow breuitie, &amp; only Å¿et down a few lines out of that profound and Å¿ingular PhiloÅ¿opher <hi>Raymund Lully:</hi> who in the 32. Chapter of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his TeÅ¿tament writeth thus. <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿ed be our glorious and omnipotent God who hath giuen mankinde knowledge and vnderÅ¿tanding to ioyne and integrate the confuÅ¿ed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularitie of all Medicines with one reall vniuerÅ¿alitie, by which all things be and continue rectified. Therefore Sonne I warne thee, if thou deÅ¿ireÅ¿t to be a perfect PhyÅ¿ition, Å¿et not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:280:12"/> thy PractiÅ¿e on the particularities of Medicine, or the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intentions of PhyÅ¿icke, becauÅ¿e they be confuÅ¿ed, and at this day not Å¿ound, nor perfect. For nature cannot endure them, by reaÅ¿on of their too much confuÅ¿ion, but is beÅ¿t plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed or Å¿atisfied with and in one only Medicine. BecauÅ¿e there is but one Medicine truly curing all Infirmities, and comforting the Å¿pirituall vertues and powers of life, &amp;c.</hi> And a litttle after in the Å¿ame. <hi>He that knoweth how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce moÅ¿t particularities or vertues (for the intention of Curing diÅ¿eaÅ¿es) vnto one vniuerÅ¿alitie (of Å¿ubiect) Å¿hall bee the moÅ¿t excellent amongÅ¿t PhyÅ¿itions. In particular Medicines vertues bee confuÅ¿ed: but in an vniuerÅ¿all, they bee reall, vnited, and actiue, as the whole courÅ¿e of nature Å¿heweth. And this is Medicina, Medicinarum, Å¿uperlatiuely by excellencie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue the Medicine of Medicines. And hee that hath Å¿uch a Medicine, hath a pretious gift of God. For it is an incomparable treaÅ¿ure.</hi> Thus far <hi>Raymund:</hi> who though he there Å¿peake of that great and high PhiloÅ¿ophicall Å¿ecret, yet he plainly witneÅ¿Å¿eth that there is in nature a vniuerÅ¿all Medicine: which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be made of gold, or gold made of it, It matte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not much, for either way it Å¿ufficiently proueth, the excellent properties of gold moÅ¿t agreeable to mans nature; which hauing thus farre prooued, I will here end this firÅ¿t part of this TreatiÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus, vnto moderate and well tempered Iudgements (for my intent and purpoÅ¿e in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿e) prooued, that there hath bin, and therefore may be a PanchreÅ¿ticall Medicine, for which very many learned are either Å¿earchers themÅ¿elues, or witneÅ¿Å¿es of other mens happines in attaining the Å¿ame: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the peruicacie of Å¿ome is Å¿uch, that againÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment and Å¿enÅ¿e it Å¿elfe, they will (peraduenture
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:280:13"/> conÅ¿ciouÅ¿ly) pretend the ImpoÅ¿Å¿ibilitie &amp; maintaine the negatiue: &amp; Å¿ome againe, though yeelding a poÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie &amp; maintaining the affirmatiue, wil fight in the Å¿hadow of one inÅ¿tance: contending, that thogh they granted it may be; yet this Å¿ubiect of mine, this my potable gold hath not either the true, or neere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of that Å¿o renowned and famouÅ¿ly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Medicine, powerfull and auaileable in all diÅ¿eaÅ¿es that may happen to men: I will applie my Å¿elfe to their Å¿atisfaction. My anÅ¿wer Å¿hall be breefe, and of two Å¿orts. FirÅ¿t by ReaÅ¿on: Å¿econdly, by manifeÅ¿t and cleere demonÅ¿tration of effects, of manifold experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and witneÅ¿Å¿es beyond exception: which be the maine pillers &amp; onely neceÅ¿Å¿ary Å¿ubÅ¿tructions of all knowledg in matter controuertible amongÅ¿t men.</p>
            <p>Concerning the proofes of reaÅ¿on, I haue Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Å¿atisfied that point in my other booke in the fourth, fift, and Å¿ixt chapters. Yet further I pray conÅ¿ider here with me, that there bee many pathes leading to the Å¿ame Towne, and many waies to one and the Å¿ame end. Some in their endeauours and purÅ¿uite for the attaining of a vniuerÅ¿all Medicine labour in Minerals and thoÅ¿e Mettals which reÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely bee called, and are vnperfect: Some in Salts: Å¿ome in vegetables, Å¿ome in the Animall kinde: euery one dittying the Å¿ound of the bell anÅ¿werable to his owne tune. Let each of them therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the IÅ¿Å¿ue of his owne labors. I force not againÅ¿t them. But freely profeÅ¿Å¿e that in the perÅ¿waÅ¿ion of thoÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons which haue lead mee, I reÅ¿olutely Å¿et downe my reÅ¿t for this Å¿crutinie in naturall gold, and therein haue employed my InduÅ¿try: with what Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e and happie IÅ¿Å¿ue, I appeale to the moÅ¿t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, true and vncontrollable Iudge and DoctreÅ¿Å¿e,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:280:13"/> which is experience. The centonary Fropperies of Alphabetarias, of <hi>Aurum non Aurum,</hi> Å¿hall nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the vindicting of this conÅ¿tant truth, that by my preparation, <hi>Aurum non Aurum,</hi> gold hath beene Å¿o altered in and from the compacture and Å¿oliditie of his primitiue body; and in that reÅ¿pect it may bee called, and truly is, <hi>non Aurum,</hi> not gold, but deÅ¿troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, concerning the groÅ¿Å¿e body, and altered into a Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, penetrant and volatile nature, and Å¿o exalted into the full actiuitie of a moÅ¿t precious Medicine, with all the powerfull explications of healthfull and helpfull myÅ¿teries which nature hath Å¿ealed in that body, and left to the induÅ¿trious labour of man to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. For gold is the Embleme of a magnificent and moÅ¿t princely Pallace, drawing the beholders of his naturall luÅ¿ter, to Å¿earch what excellent Iewels bee contained within that outward wall of Å¿o rich promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es. Which though they be many and admirable, yet few attaine to the fruition thereof, becauÅ¿e by externe apparences, they ayme at the latent and hidden ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: neither doe they know the right key to vnlock that rich Cabinet. And although I cannot Å¿ufficiently declare, nor prize, all the faculties (which be reÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely innumerable) of this bountifull treaÅ¿ury: yet I may and doe confidently acknowledge and profeÅ¿Å¿e, that I haue found in vÅ¿e &amp; practiÅ¿e very many of great worth; which as in themÅ¿elues, for the vÅ¿e of men they be of great worth, and eÅ¿timation, Å¿o for them, man is reciprocally bound both to ackwowledg &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully embrace, as Gods large bleÅ¿Å¿ing; who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to knock at theÅ¿e gates of Nature, that they may be opened vnto vs, that Å¿o we may finde and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the treaÅ¿ures locked therein. What man amongÅ¿t thouÅ¿and hath found out and perfected the like
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:280:14"/> magiÅ¿teriall Å¿ecret? Who is he among many, that hath not tyred his teeth in the hard Å¿hell, neuer inabled by cracking it, to come to the Å¿weet kernell, in which dwelleth this mellite and gentle liquor of gold? But I will leaue this digreÅ¿Å¿ion, and returne to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded end.</p>
            <p>There is no queÅ¿tion but that a Medicine made of<note place="margin">1. ReaÅ¿on.</note> naturall gold, diÅ¿Å¿olued without things corroÅ¿iue, and brought into a Å¿ubÅ¿tance in forme like hony, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable, potable, and diÅ¿perÅ¿eable into any liquor, is both excellent, and iuÅ¿tly to be reputed potable gold. But this Medicine of mine, made and conÅ¿iÅ¿ting in it Å¿elfe of gold, is Å¿uch (as I haue before prooued and Å¿hall further hereafter proue) therefore it is, and ought to be acknowledged for true potable gold. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition needeth none other proofe, then the conÅ¿ent of all famous writers of and vpon potable gold: The AÅ¿Å¿umption, whereupon the Inference and Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion dependeth, is prooued in my firÅ¿t publiÅ¿hed booke, as alÅ¿o out of manifeÅ¿t demonÅ¿tration, not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, to my Å¿elfe, but publike in the Å¿ight of many, not onely once done, but Å¿undry times iterated: in which proceedings, the demonÅ¿tratiue tokens mentioned in Art, are apparent: the InÅ¿trumentall water which was in the forme of common water before it was put vpon the gold, in few daies becommeth tincted, with a deepe and ruddy colour, alÅ¿o when the InÅ¿trumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall water Å¿o tincted, Å¿hall be diÅ¿tilled away, the Å¿oluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of gold remaineth in forme of hony as by PhiloÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers is Å¿pecified. In the whole magiÅ¿terie, Art or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿e I haue not kept any thing Å¿ecret, Å¿auing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trumentall water as <hi>Raymund</hi> teÅ¿tifieth. But Å¿ome will Å¿ay, If this be that true Potable gold, why do you make it common to others? Good Sirs, forÅ¿ooth I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:280:14"/> becauÅ¿e it is Å¿uch, therefore I make it common, concerning the vÅ¿e: Which being profitable to all, challengeth the right and law of nature and charitie, to be communicated to al. But that other great Å¿ecret of the PhiloÅ¿opher, not communicable to others, is onely profitable to the Author himÅ¿elf. And therfore let not this be the leÅ¿Å¿e precious in it Å¿elfe, becauÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable men receiue health and comfort thereby? The Å¿unne giueth viÅ¿ible light to the whole world. Is it therefore an inferiour Planet vnto <hi>Mercury</hi> which Å¿eldome appeares in the Å¿ight of men?</p>
            <p>Againe. That Medicine which really performeth<note place="margin">2. ReaÅ¿on.</note> the true and proper vnqueÅ¿tioned effects of <hi>Aurum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> being eÅ¿Å¿entially made of the Å¿aid Å¿ubiect, ought and needes muÅ¿t be accounted true potable gold. But this Medicine of mine, hath produced the notable effects, only proper to potable gold. Therfore it muÅ¿t needes be the Å¿ame. An affirmatiue argument from the effect to the cauÅ¿e is good and Å¿trong: as likewiÅ¿e from the cauÅ¿e to the effect. In the holy Scriptures, a Prophet Å¿hall be iudged great, by his great workes. As <hi>Elias, EliÅ¿a,</hi> and the ApoÅ¿tles raiÅ¿ed the dead, as our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t did. (It being proper only to the power of God) whoÅ¿e doctrine they as forerunners; theÅ¿e as Å¿ucceeders preached, in one verity, and the Å¿ame diuine gift. The Analogie and proportionall deduction of Inference, is a like true in Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and in all workes both of Nature and Art, whether Å¿ingular or conioyned. So our Potable gold, brought from the potentialitie of natures lock, vnto the actiuitie, which artificiall opening exciteth and manifeÅ¿teth, is knowne by his owne proper and inÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable efficacies and effects, largely affirmed in my other booke. The AÅ¿Å¿umption of this Argument,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:280:15"/> drawing the concluÅ¿ion, I will further heereafter, by examples confirme.</p>
            <p>The third ReaÅ¿on may be taken from the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie<note place="margin">3. ReaÅ¿on.</note> and wonderfull manner of working in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reÅ¿olution of gold, whereby it is brought from fixation, to volatility, and Å¿o made potable. Therefore I Å¿ay thus. WhoÅ¿oeuer can Å¿o diÅ¿Å¿olue the body of gold, that it Å¿hall not by any Art be reduced againe into fixed Å¿olide gold, but Å¿o perÅ¿iÅ¿t; doubtles hath made potable gold, medicinable and profitable for the health of man. But by Gods bleÅ¿Å¿ings in my endeauours, I haue often times done this, and Å¿til can doe it: therefore doubtleÅ¿Å¿e I haue often times made, and Å¿till can make potable gold, medicinable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for mans health. The dependence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of this propoÅ¿ition Å¿tandeth in this: That gold in his primitiue, naturall, hard, compact body, cannot communicate his internall vertues in mans body; and therefore is not medicinable. For then the formalitie of gold is not looÅ¿ened from the bridle, or freed from the bodily priÅ¿on, and bonds of coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore not eaÅ¿ily worke vpon the Å¿ubiect whereunto it is applied. But contrariwiÅ¿e, being vlti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matly and irreducibly Å¿olute, it is then apt for action. So that if the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of gold be exalted in his exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate colour, it is a true token that it is made Å¿ubtile, attenuate, and therefore Medicinable; and that the aery and fiery parts, or Elementalitie thereof, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant ouer the earthy and watery. And in this manner preÅ¿eruing the naturall vnitie of the whole compound, doe draw them (not altering the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition, but Å¿ubtiliating the Å¿ubÅ¿tance) in the exalted Å¿ymboliÅ¿me of the Å¿ame Elements. The AÅ¿Å¿umption hath the Å¿ame proofe and confirmation which the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:280:15"/> other before: that is, my very often and almoÅ¿t dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience, whereof, if need be I, can produce ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eye-witneÅ¿Å¿es of eminent rancke, and amongÅ¿t them Å¿ome learned PhyÅ¿itions, againÅ¿t whom no one dare mutter an exception. But as <hi>Auicen</hi> in his booke de <hi>AnimÃ¡</hi> maketh three kinds of proofe. 1. <hi>SophiÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. 2. Logicall,</hi> and 3. <hi>SenÅ¿ible</hi> by Å¿ight: of which it is to be vnderÅ¿tood, that by SophiÅ¿ticall there he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not falÅ¿e or counterfeit cauillings. But leauing that apart, I will content my Å¿elfe with the other twaine. The Logicall part of which we haue hitherto diÅ¿courÅ¿ed by infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of reaÅ¿on: And now, will we proceeede to the third, being of Å¿enÅ¿ible and eye-witneÅ¿Å¿ed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.</p>

               <p>Your <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> is an admirable Medicine in moÅ¿t DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es.

               <p>VVOrthy and learned friend, I write to you later then I intended, becauÅ¿e I thought it not fit to deliuer my opinion before manifold experience made, in a matter of Å¿uch worth and conÅ¿equence. <hi>Experimentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> fallax,</hi> as our great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth. But now I will breefely Å¿hew you the vertue and excellency of your medicine. The firÅ¿t triall that I made of it, was on mine owne daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about 16. yeeres old: which for two continuall dayes, was much troubled with vomitings, keeping nothing that Å¿he eat or dranke. AlÅ¿o by reaÅ¿on of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable inward torments Å¿he could not Å¿leepe one winke for the Å¿pace of two daies and nights. In which her extremities, hauing vÅ¿ed all other conuenient and commended medicines to no purpoÅ¿e, but altogether without any eaÅ¿e or mitigation of her paines, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke my Å¿elfe laÅ¿tly to your medicine, as to a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Anchor, and laÅ¿t hope. She tooke the Å¿ame and kept it, and then Å¿lept a litle. But after 2. houres Å¿he caÅ¿t againe in great abundance, and Å¿ince Å¿he hath continued perfectly well.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd triall I made thereof, was vpon a very worÅ¿hipfull gentleman, <hi>Sir William Samuell</hi> Knight. He had a burning feauer, with great violence of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all heat, Å¿o that he vtterly loÅ¿t all Å¿leepe: he had withall a weakeneÅ¿Å¿e in his kidneis, and could not make wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Sundry gliÅ¿ters were adminiÅ¿tred vnto him, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, vomits, and he was alÅ¿o let blood: All which (in my obÅ¿eruation) were Å¿o far from giuing him any eaÅ¿e, that the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e did Å¿till grow Å¿tronger, and all the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:280:21"/> Å¿ymptomes or accidents euery day worÅ¿e and worÅ¿e, and more grieuous. I perÅ¿waded the giuing of your medicine. But at the firÅ¿t I could not obtaine, that he Å¿hould take a new and vnknowne thing. At laÅ¿t by the Importunitie of his friends, and the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of his diÅ¿eaÅ¿e Å¿til increaÅ¿ing, he yeelded &amp; tooke it. In an inÅ¿tant almoÅ¿t, he felt a gentle remiÅ¿Å¿ion of his heat, &amp; a milde cooling; his Å¿pirits comforted; his kidneis Å¿trengthned, Å¿o that he made water in a reaÅ¿onable good quantity. Since which time, he neuer ceaÅ¿ed to extoll this Medicine, though in troth, hauing beene long afflicted with a moÅ¿t violent diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, he hath not as yet fully recouered his Å¿trength.</p>
               <p>The third triall I made, was vpon a maid of noble familie, which being taken with dreadfull convulÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, after Å¿ome gliÅ¿ters taken, had alÅ¿o this medicine, and was thereby perfectly cured.</p>
               <p>LaÅ¿tly, I was deÅ¿ired to Å¿end all the Å¿tore I had of this medicine, to a graue Matrone, a gentlewoman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Å¿pent with old age, and much Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, being then left to Gods mercy as at her laÅ¿t gaÅ¿pe. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently after the taking of this medicine, found much eaÅ¿e and comfortable Å¿trength in her Å¿pirits, though I thinke there be no poÅ¿Å¿ible recouering her, Å¿o Å¿pent as is aforeÅ¿aid: farewell. &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:280:22"/> was now as delightfull vnto him, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were tormenting.

After receiuing thereof, within one houres Å¿pace, it is incredible to be Å¿poken, what alleuiation I found of my languiÅ¿hings, and what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration of all my vitall parts.

We deÅ¿ire alÅ¿o Å¿ome quantity of your <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Potabile,</hi> with direction for the due adminiÅ¿trati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. This gentleman diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed is neere 80 yeares of age, of Cholericke conÅ¿titution. The firÅ¿t originall of his Infirmitie (as we coniecture) was by company of his wife being yong. Not long after in a Iourney which he tooke, when he was yet Å¿carÅ¿e Å¿ixe myles from his houÅ¿e, he was conÅ¿trained oft times for to alight from his horÅ¿e. Then did he make water, and in his water either blood, or Å¿ome Å¿ubÅ¿tance like vnto blood, peraduenture Å¿permaticall, which hath continued now many daies. AlÅ¿o euen to this time he is vnable to retaine his vrine, by the Imbecillitie of his bladder as wee Å¿uppoÅ¿e. A Gonorrhe likewiÅ¿e he was Å¿ubiect vnto. He is not as yet free from any of theÅ¿e Infirmities. We expect Å¿ome helpe from you. For your charges and counÅ¿ell, this gentleman will giue you full content. My Å¿elfe alÅ¿o will be with you this next Terme, and will not be vnthankfull.</p>

                  <p>LAÅ¿tly for my Å¿elfe, being Å¿ubiect vnto an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame migrim in my head, as PhyÅ¿itions call it, but my diÅ¿eaÅ¿e is in this manner. Many times in the yeare, being in perfect health, I Å¿hall haue my Å¿ight Å¿odenly taken away; Å¿o Å¿hall I continue halfe an houre: then Å¿hall I haue a moÅ¿t violent aking in my head, alÅ¿o a Å¿leepineÅ¿Å¿e; then a kind of Å¿tupor firÅ¿t in my lips and tongue, and Å¿o it goeth downe to my hands; I Å¿tretch them out like vnto the <hi>PalÅ¿ey,</hi> and<note place="margin">A dead PalÅ¿ey</note> thus it holds me a good while: Then it will go downe into my legs. All this while I Å¿hall haue a great deÅ¿ire to caÅ¿t, but cannot, vntill I haue beene in this fit Å¿ome 6. houres: and then with much adoe I Å¿hall caÅ¿t, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter once or twice caÅ¿ting I Å¿hall haue Å¿ome better eaÅ¿e. As long as I am in that former extremitie, I Å¿hall Å¿om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Å¿arcely be able to fetch my breath, neither to Å¿peake, nor vnderÅ¿tand, nor heare what is Å¿poken. But
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:280:30"/> at the laÅ¿t I fall aÅ¿leepe, &amp; then I begin to be wel, &amp; yet not very wel, nor in perfect good health for the Å¿pace of one whole weeke after. Now it pleaÅ¿ed God, that being at Lond. in Decem. laÅ¿t, 1613. being in preÅ¿ence of my Lord, Å¿uddenly I felt that my Å¿ight failed me, my head aked, and that my fit approached neere. Whereupon I craued pardon of my Lord, being not able to goe forward with his buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e that I had then in hand. My Lord therefore commanded mee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently to take Å¿ome <hi>Aurum Potabile;</hi> for it was then in my cuÅ¿todie. But I made the mixture Å¿omewhat more effectuall of the gold, then I was accuÅ¿tomed to doe at other times. And within one quarter of an houre after taking thereof, my Å¿pirits and Å¿enÅ¿es were comforted: the cold, which at the firÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed me, became temperate. AlÅ¿o I brake winde both vpward and downward. LikewiÅ¿e I had a deÅ¿ire to vomit, and an inclination to Å¿leepe: But my Lord would not permit me, cauÅ¿ing me to bee kept walking vp and downe. Whereby after the Å¿pace of one houre I felt my Å¿elfe very well: only my head did ake a little. But (praiÅ¿ed be God) I did not fall into my vÅ¿uall fits. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, by taking that <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> I became looÅ¿e bodied, whereas vÅ¿ually I am accuÅ¿tomed to be bound. All theÅ¿e things (if neede require) I will bee ready vpon mine oath to auouch. Thus I doe end.</p>
                  <p>EVER SINCE I TOOKE THIS Medicine I haue continued in good health, praiÅ¿ed be God.</p>

Within Å¿hort time after, the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e was diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to be the Å¿mall Pocks.

AlÅ¿o thoÅ¿e exitures which appeared, Å¿hortly after Å¿unke againe, or, as we commonly Å¿ay, went in. Hereupon, the Patient fell into that extremitie, that the eminent perill of his life could not be hid, Å¿o that all they that were about him deÅ¿paired vtterly of his recouery. Wherefore they Å¿ent to his brother, to call haÅ¿tily for the Doctors beÅ¿t accquainted with the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:280:36"/> Å¿tate of his body, which were two: Who miÅ¿Å¿ing them both, neither knowing where to Å¿eeke either of them, and being very Å¿enÅ¿ible and heauy for his brothers deÅ¿perate caÅ¿e, by chance met with me in the way, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats me to accompany him to his brother, then ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerouÅ¿ly Å¿icke. But I hearing the names of thoÅ¿e Doctors, was vnwilling to goe, being loth to giue offence: alÅ¿o that gentleman was at that time vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnknowne vnto me, whereby the rather I excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed my Å¿elfe. He replied, that I was Å¿ufficiently knowne to him by a friend of his whom I had cured, and therefore inÅ¿tantly perÅ¿iÅ¿ted, that in Å¿o honeÅ¿t and neceÅ¿Å¿ary and iuÅ¿t a cauÅ¿e I would not refuÅ¿e him. I conÅ¿ented, went with him; and being then euening I viÅ¿ited the Å¿icke gentleman his brother, and found him in a moÅ¿t deplorable Å¿tate, without Å¿leepe or any other reÅ¿t, raging and rauing. He tooke a Å¿poonfull of my <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> with which he preÅ¿ently became quiet, of a more cheerefull countenance, and fell into a gentle Å¿leepe. After one houre I gaue him an other Å¿poonfull, after which he Å¿pake aduiÅ¿edly, &amp; Å¿aid he was much comforted, &amp; Å¿o Å¿leept again, &amp; Å¿weat natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally al his body ouer. And (which was the beÅ¿t Å¿igne) the Pocks or PuÅ¿tuls did againe come out plentifully.

The next morning, one of his firÅ¿t Doctors comming &amp; finding me there with his patient, tooke that for his occaÅ¿ion to raile on me in vnÅ¿eeming termes.

After my departure, what coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or aÅ¿tringent, or otherwiÅ¿e qualified Syrupes, or Electuaries, or other forme of medicine they gaue him all that day I know not. But this I know, that the next night he relapÅ¿ed into the Å¿ame cruell and deÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate accidents, in which I formerly had found him, and from which I had reÅ¿tored him: peraduenture, he fell into this relaps for want of that my medicine, Å¿o powrefull in Å¿trengthning the heart, and expelling poyÅ¿on from it. For doubtleÅ¿Å¿e, the exitures being Å¿topped, and the poyÅ¿on returning from the outward parts of the body, whither nature had expelled it, to the heart, the Å¿ame accidents muÅ¿t needes returne.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:280:56"/> in their waÅ¿t papers of impreÅ¿Å¿ion, haue attempted to Å¿hew the power of malicious <hi>Rhetoricke,</hi> thereby to wrong that good, which they themÅ¿elues cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto.

And Å¿uch is their pious affection towards all others whom it may concerne, that whatÅ¿oeuer happen, none of them will make vÅ¿e of this my potable gold, (which though not properly, yet emphatically may be called a diuine Medicine: and certainly with more merit, then their <hi>Gratia Dei, Manus ChriÅ¿ti, Benedicta Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camenta, Diuinum Medicamentum</hi>) though it would Å¿aue a thouÅ¿and liues. EÅ¿teeming (as it Å¿eemeth) that good which is Å¿o done without the SeplaÅ¿iaÅ¿ticke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, to be their diÅ¿honor, and delinement.

If we looke backe, vnto the actions of certaine PhyÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of old time euen before the age of <hi>Galen,</hi> and the admirable medicines of Å¿ome of them: we Å¿hall find not impertinent to our purpoÅ¿e, that of great <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> King of Macedon. He (as <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> in his third booke reporteth) in the extremitie of a moÅ¿t dangerous and violent diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, deÅ¿iring either preÅ¿ent helpe or death, that he might hold his appointed day of battell with <hi>Darius</hi> King of PerÅ¿ia; for that purpoÅ¿e, conÅ¿ulted with his friends and counÅ¿ellors, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy might be found in this deÅ¿perate caÅ¿e. The King diÅ¿liked al ordinary medicines, as too weake for his purpoÅ¿e. The PhyÅ¿itions would allow none Å¿uch as they called vnknowne. One PhyÅ¿ition among the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:280:57"/> reÅ¿t, named <hi>Philip,</hi> being borne in the country Acar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nania a part of Greece, offered <hi>Alexander</hi> to make him a medicine very Å¿afe to be taken, which Å¿hould Å¿peedily reÅ¿tore him to health, though the other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions knew not what it was. <hi>Parmenio</hi> a great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ellour and fauorite of <hi>Alexanders,</hi> diÅ¿Å¿waded his King from this medicine, (for he was vnwilling the King Å¿hould recouer as the Å¿equell Å¿hewed) and laboured to perÅ¿wade him, that this <hi>Philip</hi> the PhyÅ¿ition was hired by <hi>Darius</hi> for 1000. talents to poyÅ¿on him. Yet <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> tooke that PhyÅ¿icke, and finding the effect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿werable to his promiÅ¿e, after his health Å¿o Å¿uddenly and beyond expectation recouered, did afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other accuÅ¿ations, lay this for one againÅ¿t <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio,</hi> as not wiÅ¿hing him well; which altogether made vp that Iudgment which brought him to his end. And very honorablie, both rewarded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded <hi>Philip,</hi> to whom next vnder God, be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and acknowledged the preÅ¿eruation of his life. The working of that medicine, in the Å¿ame place is deÅ¿cribed, not vnlike to this of mine. In this manner, <hi>Vt vero Medicamentum, &amp;c. So Å¿oone as the Medicine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ed or Å¿pred it Å¿elfe into the veines, there might leiÅ¿urely, by little and little recouery and healthfulneÅ¿Å¿e be perceiued in all the body. FirÅ¿t the Å¿pirits and heart recouered their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and after the body alÅ¿o, Å¿ooner then could be beleeued. For Alexander after he had beene in this caÅ¿e three daies, Å¿hewed himÅ¿elfe to his Armie: which did not more ardently or affectionatly fixe their eyes vpon Alexander, then vpon Philip who had Å¿o vnexpectedly reÅ¿tored him to them: Euery one Å¿triuing who Å¿hould firÅ¿t giue him their right hand, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and thanke him.</hi> Thus much <hi>Curtius.</hi>

Therefore as I deÅ¿ire, Å¿o I iuÅ¿tly hope, that you will diÅ¿cerne betweene a blacke and a white: falÅ¿hood, and truth: light and darkneÅ¿Å¿e. That you will patroniÅ¿e, defend and keepe from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion, both me and the truth. If there be any doubt concerning the auouchment of the cures and good effects of this my potable gold, here Å¿poken of, you haue the reports, the particular names and places, and many of their owne hand writings I keepe ready at
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:280:58"/> all times, to be Å¿hewed for your further content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And I am verily perÅ¿waded, that all honeÅ¿t perÅ¿ons which haue beene recouered from their diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿es and infirmities by the good vÅ¿e of this my pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gold, will be Å¿o thankfull to God for that benefit, as to acknowledge the meanes of their recouery, and not imitate thoÅ¿e Å¿ilent 9. PhariÅ¿es clenÅ¿ed from their LeproÅ¿ie by our Sauiour: which is little leÅ¿Å¿e (if not equiualent) then againÅ¿t their owne knowledge and conÅ¿cience to deny. Of them you may know and be Å¿atisfied, that it hath done good to all, hurt to none: That it is a Å¿afe, powerfull and pleaÅ¿ing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: euen a Prince amongÅ¿t all, analogiÅ¿ing with principalitie in this. That doing much good, yet of malicious and vnÅ¿hamefull perÅ¿ons it is ill Å¿poken of as Princes oft times are. Let theÅ¿e worldling Å¿lande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, diÅ¿prooue that I Å¿ay, or prooue the contrary, if they can. If not, then it is time they would be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if not for conÅ¿cience Å¿ake, yet at leaÅ¿t for Å¿hame (if they feare any) to be Å¿ilent hereafter: though it were more for their honeÅ¿t account, to recant in print. TheÅ¿e great cures performed, realities, things of fact, often times, in Å¿undrie and diÅ¿tant places, and Å¿undry and diuers perÅ¿ons, in Å¿undry and different diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, done and performed to the great good of many, and applauÅ¿ed by common atteÅ¿tation, in all parts of the Realme, and many parts beyond the Å¿eas: This (I Å¿ay) cannot be pocketted as not done, nor Å¿o eaÅ¿ily vilified by a fine phraÅ¿e, a little good Latine: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance or Å¿ence there is none in his writing, it is meere froth, and the deceitfull inÅ¿ide of a rotten Egge, or worm-eaten nut: good for nothing but to befogge the cleere light of a knowne truth, and maintaine the inured practiÅ¿e of learned Å¿colds. Surely, this is not,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:280:59"/> White, in any tongue, Latine or Welch, howÅ¿oeuer verÅ¿ified. TheÅ¿e teÅ¿timonies for me (which will daily increaÅ¿e) Å¿hall lye and remaine to all poÅ¿terities, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Trophies, fixed in the hearts of vnderÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and honeÅ¿t men; when theÅ¿e Å¿tagie chartlets of theirs, Å¿hall not be vouchÅ¿afed an honeÅ¿t eye or eare: but caÅ¿t by for waÅ¿t paper, to Å¿top muÅ¿tard pots, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baÅ¿e offices. They are not able, to produce one InÅ¿tance, of harme receiued by this Medicine. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as contrary, the chiefeÅ¿t, moÅ¿t polychreÅ¿ticall, and greateÅ¿t magnified compoÅ¿itions (whereof (to Å¿peake truth) at this day the right Ingredients bee not knowne: and againÅ¿t which Å¿ome learned Doctors haue learnedly written) haue their Imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the charge muÅ¿t bee either vpon the Medicine it Å¿elfe, or vpon the PhyÅ¿itions. WhoÅ¿e errors, if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues will not mend, I will not excuÅ¿e. If obiection be made, that all haue not recouered, which haue taken this Medicine of mine, but Å¿ome haue died: I confeÅ¿Å¿e that is true. But what then? Old Age is irreuocable. Many diÅ¿eaÅ¿es alÅ¿o are either eÅ¿Å¿entially incurable, or preuent all power of Medicines, either by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie or malignitie <hi>Morbi acutiÅ¿Å¿imi,</hi> or by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of timely helpe. Many alÅ¿o being eaÅ¿ily to be cured at the firÅ¿t, are made deÅ¿perate and vncurable, by errors, either of Medicines directly hurtfull, or at the leaÅ¿t not helpfull, to the intollerable weakning of the poore patient, and triumph of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. AlÅ¿o <hi>Hippocrates</hi> telleth vs, that all diÅ¿eaÅ¿es be not curable. For the fatall and predeÅ¿tinate houre is ineuitable. There reÅ¿teth an vnknowne cauÅ¿e, which is the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿earchable counÅ¿ell of God, which wil not that all diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿es Å¿hall be cured in al men.

For as the Captaine of an Army, hauing any peculiar exploite in hand, neglecteth no meanes, either by Military DiÅ¿cipline, or Engines of warre, to accompliÅ¿h his intended purpoÅ¿e; Å¿o is the PhyÅ¿ition
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:280:60"/> likewiÅ¿e bound to doe.

And as in this age, both Armour and other Artillery for the Å¿eruice of warre, are farre different from thoÅ¿e of former times, Å¿o that it were ridiculous now, either in offenÅ¿iue warre or defenÅ¿iue, to relinquiÅ¿h our Ordnance of all Å¿orts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e (in compariÅ¿on) they are but late inuentions, and to truÅ¿t to the ancient military inÅ¿truments Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable among the Romans in thoÅ¿e daies: Euen Å¿o, the capitall diÅ¿eaÅ¿es of this age, being for the moÅ¿t part <hi>Complicati Morbi,</hi> whereas <hi>olim</hi> they were <hi>Å¿implices,</hi> will hardly be extirpate, if we ouercuriouÅ¿ly do perÅ¿iÅ¿t in the preÅ¿cript rules and method of antiquitie, and tye our Å¿elues only to their Medicines: Å¿eeing that daily experience doth teach vs, that they performe not the effects promiÅ¿ed, and therefore, are for the moÅ¿t part adminiÅ¿tred fruitleÅ¿ly.

               <p>Take one ounce of this tincted Å¿pirit, mixe it with<note place="margin">The Å¿econd forme.</note> 16. ounces of generous wine (or if you pleaÅ¿e, of any other liquor.) And this being Å¿o mixed is called that Potable golde, of which Å¿o often mention hath beene hitherto made. One, or two Å¿poonfuls of this at one time, and Å¿ometimes a whole ounce, I accuÅ¿tome to giue, in Å¿uch caÅ¿es and DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es as aforeÅ¿aid.</p>
               <p>The third forme is this, and thus made. That tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<note place="margin">The third forme.</note> red Å¿pirit of wine, in which the diÅ¿Å¿olued gold is taken vp from the white feces, or reÅ¿idence, is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fit glaÅ¿Å¿e body with a head. And with a gentle heate of a <hi>Balneum,</hi> the Å¿pirit is drawne off, vntill the Å¿ubÅ¿tance in the bottome of the glaÅ¿Å¿e be dry. Then doe I put on freÅ¿h Å¿pirit of wine, Å¿etting it in digeÅ¿tion certaine daies. In which time it will caÅ¿t off an other reÅ¿idence. This proceÅ¿Å¿e is reiterated, and at euery Å¿uch Å¿olution and diÅ¿tillation, the feculent reÅ¿idence muÅ¿t be Å¿eparated from the pure, vntill it leaue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idence at all. Then is it called the QuinteÅ¿Å¿ence or EÅ¿Å¿ence of God, which I doe vÅ¿e to adminiÅ¿ter in the quantity of 2. or 3. or more graines, and doe diÅ¿Å¿olue it in Å¿ome appropriate liquor or other mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conducent.</p>
               <p>So that any, that is deÅ¿irous to make vÅ¿e of this my Medicine, may haue either the Potable gold, or the Tincture of gold, or the EÅ¿Å¿ence of gold, or all; and apply them in all manner of needfull vÅ¿es, as occaÅ¿ion Å¿hall require.</p>
               <p>They therefore that Å¿hall take it for preÅ¿eruation, may vÅ¿e it in the Å¿impleÅ¿t &amp; leaÅ¿t curious order &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hion. That is, to take of the <hi>Auru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Potabile</hi> one or two Å¿poonfuls, together faÅ¿ting, and in bed, if they may, elÅ¿e in the morning after they be vp; the oftner, the better.

               <p>AlÅ¿o a conuenient time to take it (eÅ¿pecially in thoÅ¿e that haue weake Å¿tomacks) will be one houre or two before dinner or Å¿upper, or after Å¿upper, at bed time (for it doth both helpe digeÅ¿tion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Å¿leepe) according as the circumÅ¿tances Å¿hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or Å¿uffer.</p>
               <p>In precaution of Lunarie DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es, Å¿uch as haue their exacerbations &amp; fits according to the quarters, changings, &amp; full of the Moone, as <hi>EpilepÅ¿ies, Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> inordinate <hi>MenÅ¿truals</hi> and Å¿uch like: The rule is, for this laÅ¿t, to take it neere the time of courÅ¿e: In the other, 3. 4. or 5. daies before the new and full Moone.</p>
               <p>If it be deÅ¿ired for the more particular appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Medicine to any particular cauÅ¿e, to take it not Å¿o Å¿imply of it Å¿elfe, but mixed: Then let Å¿uch, either by their owne knowledge, or the appointment of Å¿ome experienced PhyÅ¿ition, mixe it with Å¿ome Å¿pecificall water, decoction, extraction, or otherwiÅ¿e formed Medicine, according to the neceÅ¿Å¿itie of euery particular cauÅ¿e and occaÅ¿ion: Or with Å¿ome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound water, approoued for that DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e, or Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chreÅ¿tall to the Å¿ame, and others, in neighbourhood and linke of cauÅ¿es to it.</p>

But where a competent PhyÅ¿ition is not at hand, as in Country villages, or Å¿uch like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there Å¿ome admonition or direction is expedient.</p>
               <p>It is well knowne among learned men, what effect, efficacy, and force, is attributed to that Medicine which is called VniuerÅ¿all, in that high degree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of writers make mention, that it performeth great and admirable effect, not only vpon mans body, but alÅ¿o vpon Mettals, as appeareth by theÅ¿e words of <hi>Raymund Lully: The quinteÅ¿Å¿ence of gold, after diÅ¿til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:280:64"/> away of the inÅ¿trumentall water, will remaine in the bottome of the glaÅ¿Å¿e, very pure, and Å¿eparated from all impurity, thicke in the conÅ¿iÅ¿tence of hony, or of gumme, deepely coloured and very vnctuous, greatly auaileable, both for Medicine of many body, as alÅ¿o of Mettals. But this Medicine of ours, hath his preparation onely pertinent to the vÅ¿e of man. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles Å¿eeing that, both that Medicine of <hi>Raymund Lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and this of mine, haue all the virtue incident vnto them deriued from gold, and from the forme thereof, as from one fountaine and foundation; therefore it will not be impertinent, to preÅ¿cribe the Å¿ame vÅ¿e and manner of adminiÅ¿tring of this medicine of mine, which <hi>Raymund</hi> doth vnto his. For if the agent cauÅ¿e be one in them both, the manner of vÅ¿e may alÅ¿o be the Å¿ame. He preÅ¿cribeth a Å¿peciall vÅ¿e in theÅ¿e words. Mixe this EÅ¿Å¿ence of gold in a quantity of white wine, when you will giue it to a Phlegmaticke conÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eÅ¿pecially in the Winter Å¿eaÅ¿on. If to a Cholericke, giue it in faire water: to a Melancholike, in broth, wherein mutton is decocted: If he be of a Sanguine complexion, in cleare white wine: And this Å¿hall be a preuention againÅ¿t infirmities, and their bodies Å¿hall be rectified againÅ¿t the diÅ¿temper of the Å¿eaÅ¿on. If you giue this medicine to thoÅ¿e that are Å¿icke, let the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be more effectuall of the Medicine. Neither be thou greatly troubled (Å¿aith he) to know the perfect Å¿tate of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. For nature it Å¿elfe is wiÅ¿e and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident by her owne inÅ¿tinct, and hath inueÅ¿ted to this Å¿tone being diÅ¿Å¿olued, Å¿ufficient virtues, to rectifie that which is amiÅ¿Å¿e in nature. <hi>My Å¿onne, this medicine is powerfull, both againÅ¿t hotte diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, and cold, naturall, and accidentiall,</hi> &amp;c. TheÅ¿e words and other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto tending <hi>Raymund</hi> Å¿etteth downe, which we out of our experience haue found to be anÅ¿werable to this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:280:65"/> our intent. NeuertheleÅ¿Å¿e wee acknowledge, that Å¿ometimes extraordinary Å¿ymptomes doe occurre, which threaten preÅ¿ent danger of death, if they bee not Å¿peedily preuented: As is, extreme heate, extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of cold, great thirÅ¿t, lacke of Å¿leepe, inordinate fluxes, and Å¿uch like. All which by the good pleaÅ¿ure of God, are mitigated and aÅ¿Å¿waged by this only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of mine. And yet many things may be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priately added hereunto, &amp; pertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t for the expulÅ¿ing of euery DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e. Therfore, if the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t haue a repleate body, that neceÅ¿Å¿ity require Å¿ome euacuation to bee made; gentle, &amp; not viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t purges, fitting the humor offending, are to be adminiÅ¿tred. Sometime the body hath neede by vrine or Å¿weat to be releeued: which both, although this <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> doe in Å¿ort per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme yet in Å¿ome caÅ¿es it is to be helped. If a fluxe be cauÅ¿ed in the nether ventricle, vnto which a Medicine receiued at the mouth cannot Å¿peedily penetrate, then a clenÅ¿ing, and aÅ¿tringent GliÅ¿ter will be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. If Å¿leepe be wanting, that neceÅ¿Å¿arily muÅ¿t be regarded. And although this Medicine doth for the moÅ¿t part by a Å¿ecret proprietie therin procure Å¿leepe, yet if neede be, let other helps be adioyned. Blood letting in conuenient time muÅ¿t not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. Other things pertinent, I referre to the diÅ¿cretion of them, whome it Å¿hall concerne.</p>

It is like the gentle and Å¿weete Marierome, manifoldly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for many vertues. Which but rubbed in the hand, yeeldeth an excellent Å¿ent, comfortable to all Å¿enÅ¿es. Of which hearb it is written, that if Å¿wine be enforced, with full Å¿ent of open noÅ¿trels to take the Å¿mell, it is mortall to them, and cauÅ¿eth them to die. Surely this is a Å¿ecret in Nature, that a thing Å¿o good in it Å¿elfe, and Å¿o agreeably helpefull to good men, Å¿hould by the malice, or brutiÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e of a SwiniÅ¿h na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be accounted poyÅ¿on.

The Chyrurgians likewiÅ¿e, in Å¿ome caÅ¿e of theirs, as in Faintings, Swoundings, ConvulÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Crampes, and where Å¿leepe and reÅ¿t are wanting, whereby great feebleneÅ¿Å¿e and deiection of Spirits

Then alÅ¿o the Apothecarie Å¿hould loÅ¿e no part of his honeÅ¿tie, of his learning, nor of his Å¿ubÅ¿tance and riches, hauing by him this Medicine, as a laÅ¿t refuge for the releefe of his forlorne patient. The Apothecarie is carefull, to haue in euery corner of his Å¿hoppe, diuers and Å¿undrie contemptible drugges, loathÅ¿ome to moÅ¿t men, now in this age of ours. My deÅ¿ire is not to detract any thing from them in their gaine or skill, but rather to adde thereunto, and the behalfe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, vnto whom I doe here dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, conÅ¿ecrate and offer, all theÅ¿e my labours; and whatÅ¿oeuer elÅ¿e is in my power.</p>
